# The 13 Laws of IT

I’ve long been fascinated by the Fibonacci sequence — a spiral that shows up everywhere in nature, art, and ancient wisdom. Out of this fascination grew the idea of structuring 13 guiding laws for IT: principles that are timeless in spirit, but expressed in the language of technology.

These laws are drawn from my own background working in IT, where I’ve seen patterns repeat across code, architecture, operations, and organizations. While the examples often come from software and infrastructure, the principles apply more broadly — to all technology systems we design, operate, and live with.

Like Fibonacci itself, these laws unfold in stages — from seed to balance to unification — each carrying its own vector of growth. Together they form a compass for building technology that is resilient, purposeful, and aligned with both human and systemic needs.

## W I: Code Quality & Modularity

**Core Definition**  
Every IT system begins with clarity of form. Code quality and modularity provide the seed conditions for all future growth. Without inner harmony — readable code, coherent boundaries, explicit contracts — systems accrue entropy until they collapse under their own weight. The origin of IT wisdom is to respect simplicity inside the codebase, before layers of scale, architecture, or infrastructure are added.

**Key Aspects**
- Readability: Code should express intent clearly, reducing cognitive load.  
- Cohesion: Each unit (function, class, service) should do one thing well.  
- Separation of Concerns: Different responsibilities are divided cleanly.  
- Explicitness: Dependencies and flows are clear, never hidden.  
- Maintainability: Systems remain understandable and extendable over time.  

**Principles**
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each component should have one reason to change.  
- Separation of Concerns: Keep responsibilities isolated to minimize ripple effects.  
- Clarity over Cleverness: Prefer obvious solutions over smart-but-obscure code.  
- Intention-Revealing Interfaces: Names and structures should make purpose self-evident.  

**IT Traditions / Contexts**
- Clean Code discipline: The practice of writing human-centered, self-explanatory code.  
- SOLID principles: Early articulation of modularity in object-oriented design.  
- Domain-Driven Design: Aligning code structure with business reality through “ubiquitous language.”  
- Software craftsmanship movement: Emphasizing quality and care in development practice.  

**Bridges**
- From before (the void): Out of nothing, a first line of code creates form — the origin seed.  
- To next (iteration): Clear modules enable small, safe changes, allowing iterative evolution.

## W II: Iteration & Resiliency

**Core Definition**  
Change is constant; resilience is built through iteration. IT systems thrive not by avoiding failure but by cycling rapidly through small experiments, validating assumptions, and learning continuously. Iteration provides resilience by reducing the blast radius of change and embedding learning into the fabric of system evolution.

**Key Aspects**
- Continuous feedback: Every change yields insight.  
- Small increments: Deliver value in slices, not monoliths.  
- Safe-to-fail: Experiments are reversible and low-risk.  
- Resilience: Systems adapt under stress.  

**Principles**
- Fail-fast: Detect problems quickly to minimize cost.  
- Feedback loops: Use tests, monitoring, and user signals as learning channels.  
- Incrementalism: Progress emerges from small, validated steps.  
- Continuous learning: Every iteration feeds improvement.  

**IT Traditions / Contexts**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Build resilience through rapid cycles of test and refactor.  
- Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD): Automate small, safe releases.  
- Chaos Engineering: Practice failure to grow confidence in resilience.  
- Agile methods: Deliver in iterative increments.  

**Bridges**
- From code clarity: Iteration builds safely on modular foundations.  
- To decoupling: Iteration reveals the need to isolate parts for resilience.

## W III:Fault Tolerance & Decoupling

**Core Definition**  
Failure is inevitable; collapse is not. Fault tolerance accepts imperfection and builds with the assumption that parts will break. Decoupling ensures failure in one part does not cascade to the whole. Together, they embody the principle of resilient impermanence — designing for continuity in a transient world.

**Key Aspects**
- Isolation: Boundaries contain failure.  
- Redundancy: Backups ensure continuity.  
- Graceful degradation: Systems bend without breaking.  
- Decentralization: No single point of failure.  

**Principles**
- Loose coupling: Dependencies are minimized and explicit.  
- Graceful degradation: Services degrade functionality, not fail catastrophically.  
- Redundancy: Critical paths have alternatives.  
- Immutability: Replace rather than mutate for predictability.  

**IT Traditions / Contexts**
- Circuit Breaker pattern: Isolate failing services.  
- Saga pattern: Manage distributed transactions through compensation.  
- Immutable infrastructure: Replace servers instead of patching.  
- Hexagonal/Clean architecture: Isolate core logic from changing edges.  

**Bridges**
- From iteration: Fail-fast cycles uncover where decoupling is needed.  
- To discernment: Architectural wisdom emerges from handling failure gracefully.
